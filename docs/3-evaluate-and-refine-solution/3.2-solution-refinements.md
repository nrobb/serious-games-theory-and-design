# 3.2 Solution Refinements

Your team will use your evaluation findings to **implement refinements to your team's video game**. Focus on the highest priority design changes first. Implement as many refinements as possible depending on the available time and resources prior to the public presentation.

If possible, test your game again with new participants to verify whether the refinements resolved the issues.
