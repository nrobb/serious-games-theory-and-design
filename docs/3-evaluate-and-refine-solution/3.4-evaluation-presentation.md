# 3.4 Evaluation Presentation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✓ TASK" %}
You'll create a **slide presentation** that summarizes the evaluation and refinement of your team’s video game. Practice your presentation before delivering it to your class. This will be an opportunity for other project teams to ask questions and provide constructive feedback to help your team prepare for the public presentation.

Your team's presentation should include the following \(in this order\):

* **Project Team:**  product name, team name, team members & their roles
* **Game Summary:**  Use your team's Game Design Document to provide a brief summary of the game \(such as its premise, objective\(s\), basic gameplay, etc.\).
* **Target Player Persona:**  Be sure the persona is useful for understanding the target players that the game was designed for.
* **Solution Evaluation:**  Briefly describe the participants \(number, gender, age, etc.\) involved in the playtesting of the video game. Briefly summarize the evaluation findings, including the survey results.
* **Solution Refinements:**  Briefly describe the refinements that were made to the video game. If helpful, you can include “before” and “after” images to better show certain types of changes.
* **Project Poster:**  Show a preview of the team’s project poster, and briefly explain what information is included on the poster.

The presentation should have 6-10 slides and take 5-10 minutes to deliver.
