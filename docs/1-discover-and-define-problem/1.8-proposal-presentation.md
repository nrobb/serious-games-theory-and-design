Your team's presentation should include the following \(in this order\):

1. **Project Team:** game's working title, team name, team members & their roles
2. **Target Player Persona:** Describe the persona for your game, including the targeted gaming motivations and player experience goals.
3. **Premise:** Briefly explain the game's premise — as well as its setting \(game world\), characters \(player and non-player\), and story \(if applicable\). Be sure to include concept sketches of the game world and characters.
4. **Objective:** Briefly explain the objectives of the game — as well as the conflicts that players will face. If helpful, include concept sketches.
5. **Gameplay:** Briefly explain how the game is played — as well as key gameplay features. If helpful, include concept sketches.
