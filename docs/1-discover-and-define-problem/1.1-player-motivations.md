# 1.1 Player Motivations

Just as people like different types of books or movies, people like different types of video games. If you're going to design a video game, you'll need to know more about what motivates people to play certain games.

You'll start by taking a survey to determine your own Gamer Motivation Profile. Later in the project, your team will decide which gaming motivations to target for its game concept.

[Quantic Foundry](http://quanticfoundry.com/) is a game analytics consulting company that has gathered data from over 400,000 video game players to construct a scientific model that describes different types of gaming motivations.

This model identified 12 gaming motivations that form into 6 groups. For example, _Challenge_ and _Strategy_ are gaming motivations that belong to the _Mastery_ group.
