For example, some players are motivated to play games featuring destruction and competition, some players are motivated by games featuring story and strategy, etc. Besides the type of gameplay, there are other factors that can keep players motivated and engaged in a game. We can use research findings from psychology to understand factors that motivate people to perform certain behaviors (whether playing a game, doing a task, learning something, etc.). Two of the possible ways to classify motivations include: External vs. Internal \u2014 External motivations originate outside ourselves, while internal motivations come from within ourselves. Negative vs. Positive \u2014 Negative motivations involve painful experiences, while positive motivations involve pleasing experiences. This model represents these two dimensions for classifying motivations: This model classifies motivations into four types: Negative External Motivation (punishments) Positive External Motivation (rewards) Negative Internal Motivation (feeling bad) Positive Internal Motivation (feeling good) Video game designers typically use all four of these types of motivations to help keep players engaged in the gameplay through incentives and flow . External Motivation: Incentives Incentives , such as rewards and punishments, can be very effective at getting people to do certain things. However, the effectiveness depends on the amount and frequency of the rewards or punishments. Psychologist B.F. Skinner conducted numerous studies on the effectiveness of external motivations on behavior . Rewards and punishments are commonly used in video games to help players learn how the gameplay works and to keep players engaged in the gameplay: Rewards in games might include: receiving points, gaining special abilities, etc. Punishments in games might include: losing health, losing resources, etc. An advantage of incentives is they can quickly teach and reinforce desired behaviors. Typically, people will quickly learn the cause-and-effect relationship between their actions and the incentives that result. However, a disadvantage of incentives is that people will also quickly stop performing a behavior if the rewards or punishments are removed \u2014 unless the person has developed some internal motivation to keep performing the behavior. Internal Motivation: Flow People will naturally do certain things to avoid pain (e.g., to avoid pain, fear, anxiety, embarrassment, unhappiness, etc.) and seek pleasure (e.g., to feel happy, satisfied, engaged, empowered, etc.). This internal motivation helps us fulfill basic biological, psychological, and social needs. In general, internal motivation is more effective than external motivation at determining people's behavior. Psychologist Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi conducted research on happiness, creativity, and motivation in people. He found that people performing tasks can experience a mental state of deep focus and engagement that he called flow . This is sometimes referred to this as \"being in the zone\" (which is the opposite of \"zoning out\"). If you're experiencing flow while performing a task: You are completely focused on the task (e.g., might forget to eat or rest, etc.). You have a feeling of control (e.g., feel confident, know what to do next, etc.). You aren't thinking about yourself (e.g., your worries melt away, etc.). You lose awareness of time (i.e., usually time will seem to fly by). You enjoy doing the task for its own sake (i.e., positive internal motivation). People can experience flow in many different types of tasks, including: art, music, sports, games, work, hobbies, etc. Experiencing flow requires certain conditions: Having clear goals Avoiding distractions Receiving clear, immediate feedback Having proper balance of challenges vs. skills The challenge of a task plays a critical role in whether or not the person experiences flow. This diagram shows how flow is affected by the challenge of a task compared to the person's skill level: The diagram reveals several things about challenges vs. skills: If the challenge of a task is too high compared to your current skill level, it leads to anxiety (feeling bad) \u2014 and you'll probably stop doing the task. If the challenge of a task is too low compared to your current skill level, it leads to boredom (feeling bad) \u2014 and you'll probably stop doing the task. If the challenge of a task is well-matched to your current skill level, it leads to a sense of focus and control (feeling good) \u2014 and you'll probably stay engaged in the task. You're probably in a state of flow. As you continue to perform a task, your skills tend to increase over time, so the challenges also need to increase at an appropriate rate to keep you in flow (and prevent you from becoming anxious or bored). Many video games are designed to include the right conditions to encourage a state of flow \u2014 such as clear objectives, clear feedback, balancing the game's challenges vs. the player's skills, etc. Including these conditions in your game will typically improve the gameplay experience, even if the player doesn't experience flow.

For example, we recognize checkers, soccer, and Space Invaders as being examples of games. What do these have in common that define them as being a game? We would probably agree that one element that all games have is players \u2014 people that agree to participate in the game. Checkers needs two players. Soccer needs two teams of players. Space Invaders is a single-player game. Every game has one or more players as part of its design. Game designers have come up with different ways to define the elements of games. In this assignment, you will come up with a set of game design elements by constructing an affinity diagram . An affinity diagram takes a large set of information (such as ideas, examples, notes, etc.) and sorts it into a smaller set of groups that reveal patterns and relationships. Constructing an affinity diagram involves three basic steps: Record each piece of information separately . If possible, record the information on index cards or sticky notes (to make it easier to sort the ideas into groups and label the groups). Otherwise, record the information as a list in a document. Sort related pieces of information into groups . You can have as many groups \u2014 or as few groups \u2014 as you need, based on the patterns in the information. The groups will not necessarily have the same number of pieces of information. Label each group to identify the pattern or relationship it represents . Add the group's label using a new card or note \u2014 or add the label to your document. Assignment Work in a small team (2-4 people) to construct an affinity diagram of the elements that define games. It might help to focus on a small number of specific games (such as: checkers, soccer, Space Invaders, etc.). What are the specific elements that define each game?

You'll start by deciding: What kind of gameplay experience do you want to design? Who are the target players you're designing this game for? The first step is to select gaming motivations to target for the gameplay experience. Most games target more than one gaming motivation, often from different motivation groups. This can allow the gameplay to be more complex and appeal to more players. You'll use Quantic Foundry's Gamer Motivation Model, which identifies 12 different gaming motivations that form into 6 motivation groups (Action, Social, Mastery, Achievement, Immersion, and Creativity). For example, a team might decide to target the gaming motivations of Excitement, Strategy, and Story (which are from the groups of Action, Mastery, and Immersion). Next, your team will create player experience goals based on your targeted gaming motivations. Player experience goals describe what players will do, think, or feel during your gameplay. Player experience goals will help narrow your focus for brainstorming game ideas, while still being general enough to allow a range of possible game design features. For example, some possible player experience goals for a game targeting Excitement, Strategy, and Story might be: Players will have to make quick decisions weighing risk vs. reward. Players will feel a sense of tension during the gameplay. Finally, your team will use its targeted gaming motivations and player experience goals to create a persona representing a possible target player for your game. A persona is a model of a target user for a product or service, such as an app, website, device, etc. The persona summarizes the target user\u2019s background, motivations, goals, needs, and expectations. The persona is used as a reference throughout the design process to help ensure your solution meets the needs of your target users. Normally, a persona is based on user research data gathered through interviews, surveys, observations, etc. However, in this case, you'll create a fictional (yet realistic) persona based on your targeted gaming motivations and player experience goals.

Then you'll gather external feedback to help select and refine one game concept as your team's proposed project. A game treatment is a written summary of a game concept that includes concept sketches of the game world and characters. In the gaming industry, game treatments are used to get feedback on game concepts, as well as to pitch game concepts to get approval and funding to create them. Once a game treatment is approved, the team creates a detailed game design document and then begins to prototype the game.

Be sure your top game concepts match your team's targeted gaming motivations and player experience goals listed in your persona. Be sure your top game concepts seem engaging and innovative \u2014 as well as technically feasible to prototype. Use this template to create a game treatment for each of your team's top 3 game concepts. The written summary will be brief (working title + 3 paragraphs). The concept sketches are just rough mockups. Be sure to include captions or labels for the sketches. Decide on a plan for each team member to contribute to the game treatments by writing, editing, and/or sketching. Be sure the game treatments will make sense to people outside your team, so you can get useful feedback. Pair with another team to critique each other's game treatments . Review one game treatment at a time. The design team should share its target player persona, so the reviewers are aware of the targeted gaming motivations and player experience goals. The reviewers should read the game treatment and then provide constructive feedback and ask questions. The design team can respond to the feedback and ask follow-up questions.

Then you'll gather external feedback to help select and refine one game concept as your team's proposed project. A game treatment is a written summary of a game concept that includes concept sketches of the game world and characters. In the gaming industry, game treatments are used to get feedback on game concepts, as well as to pitch game concepts to get approval and funding to create them. Once a game treatment is approved, the team creates a detailed game design document and then begins to prototype the game. As a team, evaluate and refine your team's game concepts to select your top 3 game concepts. You can critique ideas, filter out ideas, revise ideas, and add new ideas. Be sure your top game concepts match your team's targeted gaming motivations and player experience goals listed in your persona. Be sure your top game concepts seem engaging and innovative \u2014 as well as technically feasible to prototype. Use this template to create a game treatment for each of your team's top 3 game concepts. The written summary will be brief (working title + 3 paragraphs). The concept sketches are just rough mockups. Be sure to include captions or labels for the sketches. Decide on a plan for each team member to contribute to the game treatments by writing, editing, and/or sketching. Be sure the game treatments will make sense to people outside your team, so you can get useful feedback. Pair with another team to critique each other's game treatments . Review one game treatment at a time. The design team should share its target player persona, so the reviewers are aware of the targeted gaming motivations and player experience goals. The reviewers should read the game treatment and then provide constructive feedback and ask questions. The design team can respond to the feedback and ask follow-up questions.

External playtesting of a game is similar to user testing of a website, app, or device. Conducting this evaluation will help determine how well your game meets the project challenge criteria (i.e., is your game innovative, engaging, functional, usable, and balanced). Your team will use the evaluation data to identify issues with your game and make improvements before the public presentation. Prepare Survey Save a copy of this survey form in your team's shared folder. Open your saved copy of the survey, and modify the last question to list your game's targeted gaming motivations. Each participant will complete this survey after playtesting your game. Recruit Participants You'll need 3-5 participants to playtest your game in individual sessions. Ideally, the participants should be similar to your target player persona \u2014 especially in terms of gaming motivations. Explain Playtesting Process Let the participant know the game is being tested, not the participant. Let the participant know the game is a work-in-progress. Ask the participant to \u201cThink Aloud\u201d while playing the game. Do NOT explain your game because you need to observe first impressions. Observe Playtesting Allow the participant to play the game for about 5-10 minutes. Record notes on issues you see or hear the participant experiencing. If necessary, remind the participant to think aloud while playing. Ask Follow-Up Questions Afterwards, you can ask the participant about specific issues you observed (if you need to better understand why the issue occurred). Administer Survey Open your saved survey, and click the \"Preview\" icon (at top-right of form) to allow the participant to take the survey. Afterwards, be sure to thank the participant for their time and feedback. Analyze Data After all the participants have completed the playtesting and survey, review your playtesting session notes, and summarize your game's issues in this evaluation findings table . For each issue, you'll estimate its severity, identify a possible fix, and estimate the feasibility and priority of making the fix. Next, open your survey, and click the \"Responses\" tab (at top) to show the summary of the participants' responses. For each survey question, there will be a histogram (similar to bar chart) showing the distribution of the responses: Ratings of 1 or 2 are negative because the participant either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement. Ratings of 3 are neutral because the participant neither agreed or disagreed with the statement. Ratings of 4 or 5 are positive because the participant either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement. After each histogram, you\u2019ll see the participants' explanations for their ratings. If these reveal any new issues with your game, add them to your evaluation findings table. Create a document that will contain all the histograms (in order) for your survey data. Hover over the top-right corner of each histogram, click the copy icon, and paste each histogram into the document.","title":"3.1 Solution Evaluation"},{"location":"3-evaluate-and-refine-solution/3.1-solution-evaluation/#31-solution-evaluation","text":"You'll have people outside your team playtest and evaluate your video game.

The poster will be a visual reference to supplement the explanation and demonstration that your team gives during the public presentation event. Even though a poster won't explain or show everything about your team's project, a person should be able to understand the key aspects of your team's project just by reviewing your poster. The goal is for the poster to be clear, concise, engaging, and professional in terms of its content and visual design. The standard size for a large poster is 36 inches wide by 24 inches tall (your teacher will clarify if a different poster size will be used). Print-quality materials typically use a resolution of 300 pixels per inch. Your teacher will have the posters printed prior to the public presentation. Determine the content to be included on the poster. Gather text and images from your team's previous project deliverables. You may need to modify certain content to make it more suitable for a poster (e.g., text might need to be summarized or simplified, images might require labels or captions, etc.). Determine the layout of the content by sketching a small-scale poster mockup on a regular sheet of paper. Be sure the layout will be easy to understand and follow. Create a full-scale digital version of the poster using a drawing/illustration tool, such as Google Drawing, Pixlr Editor, Adobe Illustrator, etc. Be sure the visual design of the poster reinforces the concept behind your team's robot solution.
